## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - TailwindCSS
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React Hook Form

### What I learned

This was my first time using react-hook-form. On my first attempt at this challenge, I had created components with use of state and refs to create a dynamic form, and everything worked apart from the clear functionality. I done some research on the standard ways developers tackle forms in React and react-hook-form seemed to be the standard. I spent a bit of time reading the documentation and applied it to this challenge, and could see immediately why react-hook-form is an industry standard - it took a lot of the work out and was simple to use.

### Continued development

As always, I will keep doing these challenges alongside the Udemy courses I am following to reinforce my learning and further develop my skills.
